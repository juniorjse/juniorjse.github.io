I work as a software developer specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs). My tech stack includes Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development. I create and implement LLM-powered applications, focusing on building responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

I develop full-stack applications using React and JavaScript for frontend interfaces while implementing backend solutions with C\#, Go, and Java. My development experience extends to mobile platforms through Swift and Android Studio. I enhance application delivery by integrating Docker and Kubernetes for containerization alongside Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines. This comprehensive approach allows me to create efficient, scalable solutions while maintaining system performance through monitoring tools like Grafana and Datadog

**Inclusive Monitor (NAI \- UFCG)                                                                                                        Set 2023 \- Dec 2023**

The inclusive monitor's main function is to offer support to students with disabilities, providing accessibility in the academic environment. It assists in adapting teaching materials, supporting learning activities, and integrating students into classes, aiming to promote equal opportunities and full participation for all.

I developed applications for the education and healthcare sectors using Unity with C\# and Typescript, integrated with AWS services for data storage and management. I also managed teams by organizing tasks and monitoring project progress, ensuring that technological solutions were aligned with the specific needs of each area.

**Software Developer (LSI \- UFCG)                                                                                                     Jan 2022 \- Sep 2022**
